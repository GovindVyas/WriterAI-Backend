# **WriterAI** 

**WriterAI** is an AI based content writing tool that helps users easily write high quality emails, blogs, letters, thesis and other stuff. One can also share their project with others and work as a team.

This project is developed by **Team 404** for Hashnode x PlanetScale hackathon. This team comprises of [Ishant](https://github.com/ishantchauhan710/) and [Vaibhav](https://github.com/Vaibhav2002).

## Technical details

- The frontend of WriterAI is created using technologies like CSS, ReactJS and MaterialUI. WriterAI is highly responsive and is tested on all popular browsers like Chrome, Safari and Opera Mini. For handling the react state\s, ContextAPI is used. The frontend code is highly structured and BEM convention is followed throughout the entire CSS code.

- The backend of WriterAI is built using the power of Ktor, Kotlin and PlanetScale! It follows MVC architecture, DRY and SOLID code principles. Currently, the backend part is deployed on Linode, which is a popular cloud service provider platform for deploying your backend and database!


### Setup [Backend]
To setup the backend of WriterAI,

1. Clone this repository and open it in Intellij IDEA IDE
2. Add the environment variables listed below
3. Create an account on Linode and there, setup an ubuntu server using their docs
4. Install java, nginx, ufw and certbot
5. Open ports for http and https using ufw
6. Set up NGINX by going through linode's docs. Ensure that it listens to 8080 port
7. Enable SSL using certbot (You will be needing a domain for that)
8. Now in Intellij IDEA, install shadowJar plugin and export the fat jar file
9. Upload that jar file to linode using scp tool in linux from your local machine
10. Then open your linode's terminal on your local machine using ssh
11. Then type:

```
vim /etc/environment
```

```
12. Then in the file opened, type:

export DB_URL = planetscale-url
export DB_USERNAME = planetscale-username
export DB_PASSWORD = planetscale-password
export PORT = 8080
```

13. Then press Ctrl+W to save and Ctrl+QA! to exit
14. Then go back to root directory by writing cd ../../ and then in terminal, write:

```
source /etc/environment
```

This will update the environment variables

15. Lastly, setup a firebase account and setup up Firebase ADMIN SDK by following [this](https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup#initialize-sdk) and paste the config json file in resource folder. Ensure that you need to use the same file for frontend part as well

16. Finally, start the server by going to the directory where you backend jar file is and writing:
```
java -jar your_backend_file.jar
```

### Server Configurations

    val email: Column<String> = varchar("email", 500).uniqueIndex()
    val username: Column<String> = varchar("username", 100)
    val totalApiReqMade: Column<Int> = integer("totalApiReqMade")
    override val id: Column<EntityID<String>> = varchar("id", 100).entityId()
    override val primaryKey = PrimaryKey(id)
}
```
#### Project Schema
```kotlin
